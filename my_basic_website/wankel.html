      <h3>The 'rotary' engine.</h3>

      <p> Play the audio segment for an example of rotary engined Le Mans racecar start-up:</p>

      <p>The Wankel rotary engine is not your typical cylinder/piston scenario. By the cross-section shown below your can see a triangluar shape which drives the eccentric shaft within. This probably means nothing to you yet.</p>

        <p>This animation shows the Wankel in action. As the triangular rotor goes around there is a cycle of combustion.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon the 'intake' phase a mixture of gaseous fuel and air is input into one of the temporal cavities between the triangular rotor and the rotor housing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the rotor momentum drives it round (there is also likely to be at least one other rotor operating on the same eccentric shaft within a different housing, with an advanced or retarded timing compared to the rotor in question) the fuel/air mix reaches the compression stage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Where the rotor is driven around the '8' figure the gas is forced to compress into a shrinking space.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the cavity reaches it's smallest point the gas is split into 2 segments by contact point of the housing on the rotor - 2 spark plugs then detonate the fuel in the air.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The expansion of the gas under combuston pushes the rotor around as the gas seeks a way to dissipate it's pressure in a larger cavity - the ignition phase (this is where the drive comes from).</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the gases' energy is dissipated turning the rotor around, it reaches the exhaust phase where an exhaust port allows the excess gas (now not sufficiently pressurised) to escape.</p>
