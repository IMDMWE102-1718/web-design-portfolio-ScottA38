      <h3>A 'Supercharged' engine</h3>

      <p>Play the audio segment for an example of a 1<sup>st</sup> generation Mini Cooper S with a modified supercharger accelerating:</p>

      <p>In car terms, superchargers are as old as houses - they were around in the prime of 'Merica's drag racing heyday and are still ocassionally used to boost the power output of a commercially made car engine without massively increasing footprint or dramatically changing engine characteristics. See the image below for an inside view of a supercharger:</p>

      <p>A supercharger is the most basic commonly used methods of forced induction. By taking drive from the engine's driveshaft via a pulley such as a belt pulley it drives a mechanism as shown in the above photos. In the instance of the 'twin-screw' example 2 Archimedian screws or 'worm screws' operating in opposing directions force air coming through through the gaps in the screws into the car's cold intake pipe</p>

      <p>This forced induction methos often has a <u>very</u> distintive noise when under heavy load (acceleration), known as a forced induction 'whine'.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Superchargers are good because they are a less expensive alternative in forced induction; peripherals such as blow-off valves and Intercoolers are not necessarily required, the original purhase cost is less than what a turbocharger kit might be and dependent on power gain there is limited engine remapping required.</p>
